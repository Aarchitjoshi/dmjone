# THANKS

    To our beloved caffeine dealers, without whom this website would never have seen the light of day. To the internet for teaching us everything we know. To the teachers who taught us how to read on the internet. And, of course, to our moms for never giving up on us and encouraging us to pursue our dreams.

# TECHNOLOGY COLOPHON

    CSS3, HTML5, jQuery, JavaScript, Apache Server Configs, jQuery, Modernizr, Normalize.css, highlight.js, and bootstrap - we don't know half of these things are, but our web guy sure does...! Oh, that's me?? Oh, Snap - we totally didn't copy and paste the source code from somewhere. Nope, not us.

Look, we may not be the most prominent team out there... and how come I, as a single-person team, may become!? In any case, we're passionate and hardworking and know our stuff. We believe in making education accessible for all, and we're not afraid to get our hands dirty (or our keyboards greasy) to make it happen. So hit us if you like what you see - we'd love to chat.

And for everyone else, thanks for stopping by. We hope you enjoy the website as much as we enjoy making it. Keep fighting the good fight, and Thank you again for taking the time to read our human.txt file. We hope you had a good chuckle, and don't forget to spread the word about making education accessible for all!
