        <h4>Basics of OOPS</h4>
        <p>Classes and objects: Classes are blueprints that define the structure and behavior of objects. Objects are instances of classes that hold data and perform actions.</p>
        <p>Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data and functions within a class, allowing control over access to the data and hiding internal implementation details.</p>
        <p>Inheritance: Inheritance allows the creation of new classes by inheriting properties and behaviors from existing classes, enabling code reuse and creating class hierarchies.</p>
        <p>Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability to use objects of different types interchangeably. It allows objects to be treated as instances of their own class or any of its base classes.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h4>C++ Language Features:</h4>
        <p>Classes and objects: Classes define the structure of objects, including their properties (data) and behaviors (functions). Objects are specific instances of classes.</p>
        <p>Constructors and destructors: Constructors are special functions used to initialize objects, while destructors are used to clean up resources when objects are destroyed.</p>
        <p>Static and constant members: Static members are shared by all objects of a class, while constant members cannot be modified once initialized.</p>
        <p>Operator overloading: Operator overloading allows defining custom behaviors for operators such as +, -, *, and /, enabling objects to be manipulated using familiar syntax.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h4>Inheritance and Polymorphism:</h4>
        <p>Inheritance types: Single inheritance involves creating a new class from a single base class. Multiple inheritance allows inheriting from multiple base classes. Multilevel inheritance involves creating a chain of derived classes.</p>
        <p>Base and derived classes: Base classes are the existing classes from which new classes are derived. Derived classes inherit properties and behaviors from base classes.</p>
        <p>Virtual functions and function overriding: Virtual functions are functions declared in base classes that can be overridden in derived classes, enabling runtime polymorphism.</p>
        <p>Object slicing: Object slicing occurs when a derived class object is assigned to a base class object, leading to the loss of derived class-specific features.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h4>Data Abstraction and Encapsulation:</h4>
        <p>Access specifiers: Access specifiers (public, private, and protected) control the visibility of class members. Public members are accessible outside the class, private members are accessible only within the class, and protected members are accessible within the class and its derived classes.</p>
        <p>Data encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and related functions within a class. It allows for data hiding and providing controlled access through public interfaces.</p>
        <p>Getters and setters: Getters and setters are methods used to access and modify private data members, ensuring controlled access to the data.</p>
        <p>Friend functions and classes: Friend functions or classes have access to private and protected members of a class, even though they are not members of the class.</p>

        <h4>Advanced OOPS Concepts:</h4>
        <p>Templates and generic programming: Templates allow writing generic code that can work with different data types, enabling code reusability and flexibility.</p>
        <p>Exception handling in classes: Exception handling mechanisms, such as try-catch blocks, can be used within classes to handle and manage errors and exceptional conditions.</p>
        <p>Virtual base classes and the diamond problem: Virtual base classes are used to resolve the diamond problem, which occurs in multiple inheritance when a derived class has two base classes that share a common base class.</p>
        <p>RTTI (Run-Time Type Identification): RTTI allows determining the type of an object at runtime, enabling dynamic type checking and casting.</p>
        <p>Object-oriented design patterns: Design patterns are reusable solutions to common design problems. Examples include Singleton (ensuring a class has only one instance), Factory (creating objects without specifying their concrete classes), Observer (defining a one-to-many dependency between objects), and Strategy (defining a family of algorithms and making them interchangeable).</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h4>Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD):</h4>
        <p>UML diagrams: UML is a visual modeling language used to represent classes, objects, relationships, and interactions. Class diagrams show the structure of classes, while object diagrams depict instances of classes.</p>
        <p>Use cases, actors, and scenarios: Use cases define interactions between actors (users or systems) and the system being developed. Actors represent entities interacting with the system, and scenarios describe specific interactions or sequences of actions.</p>
        <p>Design principles: SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion) guide software design by promoting modularity, maintainability, and extensibility.</p>
        <p>Design patterns: Design patterns provide proven solutions for common design problems. Examples include Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy, and many others.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h4>Standard Template Library (STL):</h4>
        <p>Containers: STL provides various containers such as vector (dynamic array), list (linked list), map (associative array), and more, for storing and manipulating data.</p>
        <p>Iterators and algorithms: Iterators are used to traverse and access elements within containers. Algorithms are generic functions that operate on containers using iterators, performing tasks like sorting, searching, and modifying elements.</p>
        <p>Function objects and predicates: Function objects (functors) are objects that can be called like functions, enabling custom behaviors in algorithms. Predicates are functions or function objects that return a Boolean value, used for conditions in algorithms.</p>
        <p>Generic algorithms and data structures: STL provides a rich collection of generic algorithms and data structures that can be readily used in C++ programs, promoting code reuse and efficient programming.</p>

        <h4>Memory Management and Resource Handling:</h4>
        <p>Dynamic memory allocation: C++ allows allocating memory dynamically using the new operator and deallocating it using the delete operator. This allows for flexible memory management during program execution.</p>
        <p>Memory leaks and smart pointers: Memory leaks occur when dynamically allocated memory is not freed, resulting in wasted memory. Smart pointers (e.g., unique_ptr, shared_ptr, weak_ptr) are smart memory management objects that automatically deallocate memory when it is no longer needed.</p>
        <p>RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principle: RAII is a technique where resources (such as memory, file handles, etc.) are tied to the lifespan of objects. Resources are acquired during object initialization and released during object destruction, ensuring proper resource handling and preventing resource leaks.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h4>Object-Oriented Software Development Principles:</h4>
        <p>Modularization and code organization: Modularization involves dividing code into smaller, manageable modules, improving readability, maintainability, and reusability.</p>
        <p>Code reusability and maintainability: Object-oriented programming emphasizes reusable code components, reducing code duplication and making maintenance easier.</p>
        <p>Testing and debugging techniques: Testing ensures the correctness of code through techniques like unit testing, integration testing, and debugging. These processes identify and fix errors and ensure the software functions as expected.</p>
        <p>Documentation and software development life cycle: Documentation provides descriptive information about code, APIs, and system functionality. The software development life cycle encompasses the stages of software development, including requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.</p>
