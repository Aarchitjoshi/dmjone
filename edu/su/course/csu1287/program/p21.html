        <h3>1. Introduction to Virtual Functions in C++</h3>
        <p>In object-oriented programming, polymorphism is one of the key principles that allows developers to create extensible and maintainable code. Polymorphism is a concept where an object of a derived class can be treated as an object of its base class. Virtual functions in C++ are a powerful mechanism that enables polymorphism by allowing derived classes to override the behavior of base class functions.</p>
        <p>This article will provide a comprehensive discussion of virtual functions, along with other related topics such as friend functions, static functions, assignment and copy initialization, the 'this' pointer, and dynamic type information. The aim is to cover the topic of virtual functions from the basics to a level suitable for computer science students, making it an informative and valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about this core aspect of C++ programming.</p>

        <h3>2. Virtual Functions</h3>
        <p>A virtual function is a member function of a base class that can be overridden in a derived class. This allows derived classes to provide their own implementation for the function while maintaining the same function signature as the base class. When a derived class object is accessed through a pointer or reference to the base class, the appropriate derived class function is called, even if the base class pointer or reference is used. This dynamic binding enables polymorphism in C++.</p>

        <h4>2.1 Declaration and Usage of Virtual Functions</h4>
        <p>To declare a function as virtual, you simply use the 'virtual' keyword in the function declaration within the base class. This tells the compiler to generate a virtual table (vtable) containing pointers to the virtual functions for each class that contains or inherits a virtual function. When an object is created, a pointer to the vtable for its class is set up, allowing dynamic dispatch of the virtual function calls at runtime.</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">class Base {
public:
    virtual void print() {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Base class print function." &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void print() override {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Derived class print function." &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
};</code></pre>
        <p>In the example above, the 'print' function is declared as virtual in the 'Base' class and overridden in the 'Derived' class. When a 'Derived' class object is accessed through a 'Base' class pointer or reference, the 'print' function of the 'Derived' class will be called, illustrating polymorphism in action.</p>

        <h4>2.2 Pure Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes</h4>
        <p>A pure virtual function is a virtual function with no implementation in the base class. A class containing at least one pure virtual function is considered an abstract class and cannot be instantiated. Derived classes must provide an implementation for all pure virtual functions in the base class; otherwise, the derived class will also be considered abstract.</p>
        <p>To declare a pure virtual function, use the 'virtual' keyword followed by the function declaration and assign it to 0, as shown below:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-cpp">class AbstractBase {
public:
    virtual void pure_virtual_function() = 0;
};</code></pre>
        <p>Derived classes must override the pure virtual function(s) to become a concrete class, which can then be instantiated. Abstract classes serve as a foundation for other classes, ensuring a consistent interface and promoting code reusability.</p>
