            <article>
                <p>
                    <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code> is a preprocessor directive that includes the standard
                    input/output library in
                    the program. This library contains functions such as <code>printf()</code> and <code>scanf()</code>
                    that are used to
                    display output and take input from the user, respectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>int main()</code> is the main function of the program. It is the entry point of the program,
                    where the
                    execution of the program starts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the main function, a floating-point variable <code>d</code> and three more floating-point
                    variables
                    <code>m</code>, <code>j</code>, and <code>o</code> are declared. Then, a prompt is displayed to the
                    user explaining
                    the calculation of the gross salary of an employee based on the given norms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The program then checks if the basic pay entered by the user is greater than 25000. If it is, the
                    value of the
                    variables <code>m</code> and <code>j</code> are set to 20 and 50, respectively. If the basic pay is
                    less than or
                    equal to 25000, the values of <code>m</code> and <code>j</code> are set to 15 and 25, respectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The gross salary of the employee is then calculated by adding the basic pay and the amounts of HRA
                    and DA. The
                    calculated gross salary and the amounts of HRA and DA are then displayed to the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the program returns 0, indicating that the program executed successfully.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The output of the program will look like this:<br>
