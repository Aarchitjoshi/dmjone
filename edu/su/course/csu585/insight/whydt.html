                <h2 class="text-center">Why Design Thinking?</h2>
            </article>
            <article>
                <p>Design thinking is a buzzword that has been thrown around a lot in recent years, but what does it really mean? And why should we care about it?</p>

                <p>Design thinking is not just a way of making things look nice or work well. It is a way of thinking and making that keeps the user at the center of everything. It is a human-centered approach to developing products, services, and experiences that solve real problems and create value for people .</p>

                <p>Design thinking is also not just a skill or a tool that can be applied to any situation. It is a mindset and a culture that fosters creativity, collaboration, empathy, experimentation, and learning . It is a way of seeing the world differently and finding new possibilities.</p>

                <p>Design thinking has been used by designers for decades, but it has also gained popularity among other fields and disciplines such as business, education, engineering, health care, social innovation, and more . The reason for this is simple: design thinking helps us tackle complex and ambiguous challenges that require innovation and adaptation.</p>

                <p>So how does design thinking work? There are many models and frameworks that describe the design-thinking process, but one of the most widely used ones is the five-stage model developed by Stanford University's d.school:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Empathize</strong>: research your users' needs</li>
                    <li><strong>Define</strong>: state your users' problems</li>
                    <li><strong>Ideate</strong>: challenge assumptions and create ideas</li>
                    <li><strong>Prototype</strong>: start to create solutions</li>
                    <li><strong>Test</strong>: try your solutions out</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These stages are not linear or sequential; they are iterative and cyclical. They can be repeated or revisited as needed throughout the project. The goal of each stage is to learn more about the user's perspective, understand their pain points and desires, generate diverse and innovative concepts, build low-fidelity prototypes to test assumptions and get feedback quickly.</p>

                <p>Design thinking may sound simple in theory, but it can be challenging in practice. It requires curiosity, openness, humility, and courage. It requires letting go of preconceived notions, embracing uncertainty, and being willing to fail fast and learn from mistakes. </p>

                <p>Design thinking also requires collaboration across disciplines, stakeholders, and cultures. It requires listening actively, communicating effectively, and co-creating solutions with empathy.</p>

                <p>Design thinking can be applied to any problem or opportunity that involves human needs, whether it's designing a new product, improving an existing service, or creating social impact. It can help us discover unmet needs, identify new opportunities, and deliver better outcomes for people.</p>

                <p>Design thinking is not just a trend or a fad; it's a powerful way of making positive change in the world. It's not about finding the right answer; it's about asking the right questions. It's not about following rules; it's about breaking boundaries. </p>

                <p>Design thinking is not just something we do; it's something we are.</p>
