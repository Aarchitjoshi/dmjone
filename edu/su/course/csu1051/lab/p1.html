                <h3>What is data?</h3>
                <p>
                    Data can be defined as collection of a distinct piece of information that is representation of facts, concepts, or instructions in a formalized manner, which should be suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing by human or electronic machine.

                <h3>What is information</h3>
                <p>
                    Information is organized or classified data, which has some meaningful values for the receiver. Information is the processed data on which decisions and actions are based.

                <h3>What is Database</h3>
                <p>A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. Database is a place where data is stored. </p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>What is Big Data</h3>
                <p>Big data is a term that can be defined as data sets whose size or type is beyond the ability of traditional relational databases to capture, manage and process the data with low latency. Characteristics of big data include high volume, high velocity and high variety.</p>

                <h3>What is Warehouse</h3>
                <p>
                    A data warehouse, or enterprise data warehouse (EDW), is a system that aggregates data from different sources into a single, central, consistent data store to support data analysis, data mining, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning. A data warehouse system enables an organization to run powerful analytics on huge volumes (petabytes and petabytes) of historical data in ways that a standard database cannot. It is a type of data management system that is designed to enable and support business intelligence (BI) activities, especially analytics.

                <h3>What are the types of Data Structure</h3>
                <p>
                    A data structure is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications. Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently.
                </p>
                <p>Data Structure are basically divided into two types:</p>
                <article>
                    <h5>Linear data structure</h5>
                    <p>Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure.
                        Examples of linear data structures are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.</p>
                    <article>
                        <h5>Static data structure</h5>
                        <p>Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure.
                            An example of this data structure is an array.</p>
                    </article>
                    <article>
                        <h5>Dynamic data structure</h5>

                        <p>In the dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code.</p>
                        <p>Examples of this data structure are queue, stack, etc.</p>
                    </article>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h5>Non-linear data structure</h5>
                    <p>Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run only.</p>
                    <p>Examples of non-linear data structures are trees and graphs.</p>
