                <h3>What is an Operating System?</h3>
                <p>An Operating System (OS) is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs. The OS acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware. It enables user interaction with the hardware in an efficient and secure manner, managing tasks such as memory allocation, process scheduling, input/output operations, and file management.</p>

                <h3>Functions of an Operating System</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Process Management</strong>: Manages the execution of processes, including process scheduling, creation, termination, and synchronization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Memory Management</strong>: Allocates and manages the computer's primary memory, addressing, and swapping between main memory and disk during execution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Storage Management</strong>: Oversees data storage and retrieval on storage devices, managing file systems, directories, and permissions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Device Management</strong>: Controls hardware devices through their respective drivers, managing input/output operations and buffering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security and Access Control</strong>: Protects system resources from unauthorized access while ensuring data integrity and privacy.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Interface</strong>: Provides interfaces for user interaction, such as command-line interfaces (CLI) or graphical user interfaces (GUI).</li>

                <h4>Batch Systems</h4>
                <p>Batch operating systems are designed to process jobs without human interaction. Jobs are collected into batches of similar needs and executed sequentially. This approach maximizes resource utilization but may increase wait times for individual jobs.</p>

            <article id="multi-programmed-systems">
                <h4>Multi-programmed Systems</h4>
                <p>Multi-programmed systems enhance computational efficiency by running multiple programs simultaneously. This is achieved by keeping multiple programs in memory at the same time, utilizing CPU idle time caused by waiting for I/O operations to complete.</p>

            <article id="time-sharing-systems">
                <h4>Time Sharing Systems</h4>
                <p>Time-sharing systems, or multitasking systems, extend the concept of multiprogramming by allocating a small time slice to each process in rotation. They offer interactive use of the system and rapid response times, allowing multiple users to share system resources simultaneously.</p>
