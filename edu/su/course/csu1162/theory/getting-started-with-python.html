            <article id="syntax">
                <h3>1. Syntax</h3>
                <p>Python syntax is the set of rules that defines how a Python program will be written and interpreted (both by the reader and by Python itself). Understanding Python's syntax is crucial for beginners as it allows you to create clean, readable, and efficient code that can execute various programming tasks.</p>

                <h4>1.1 Basic Structure</h4>
                <p>The basic structure of Python involves writing code in a way that is both intuitive and adheres to the rules of indentation. Python uses indentation, a series of spaces or a tab, to define code blocks. This approach differs from other programming languages that use curly braces or keywords. The indentation level of lines of code determines their grouping within statements like conditionals or loops.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-python"># Example of Python indentation
                        if True:
                            print("This is inside the if block")
                        print("This is outside the if block")

                <h4>1.2 Comments</h4>
                <p>Comments are essential for documenting Python code. They're ignored by the Python interpreter but provide valuable insights to developers. Single-line comments start with a hash symbol (#), while multi-line comments can be wrapped in triple quotes (''' or """). Comments are used for explaining code, making notes for future reference, or temporarily disabling code.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-python"># This is a single-line comment

                <h4>1.3 Case Sensitivity</h4>
                <p>Python is case-sensitive, meaning it distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters. Identifiers like variable names, function names, and class names are all case-sensitive. Therefore, <code>variable</code>, <code>Variable</code>, and <code>VARIABLE</code> are seen as three distinct identifiers in Python.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-python">variable = 5
                        Variable = 10
                        VARIABLE = 15
                        
                        # These are three distinct variables with different values
                        print(variable, Variable, VARIABLE)

                <h3>2. Variables and Data Types</h3>
                <p>Variables and data types are the foundation of Python programming. Variables are used to store information that can be referenced and manipulated in a program. Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't have to explicitly declare the data type of a variable. The Python interpreter automatically determines the variable's type based on the assigned value.</p>

                <h4>2.1 Variable Assignment</h4>
                <p>Assigning values to variables in Python is straightforward. You use the assignment operator (=) to assign a value to a variable. The interpreter dynamically assigns a data type based on the value.</p>

                <h5>2.2.1 Integers</h5>
                <p>Integers represent whole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals. They are often used in Python to perform arithmetic operations or as counters in loops.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-python"># Integer example
                        count = 100

                <h4>2.3 Type Conversion</h4>
                <p>Type conversion in Python is the process of converting the value of one data type to another. This is often necessary in situations where you must operate on variables of different types together. Python provides built-in functions like <code>int()</code>, <code>float()</code>, and <code>str()</code> for explicit type conversion.</p>

                <h3>2. Variables and Data Types</h3>
                <p>Variables in Python serve as "containers" for storing data values. Unlike statically typed languages, Python is dynamically typed. This means that you don't have to declare the type of variable while coding, which makes Python very flexible. The type of variable is decided at runtime by the Python interpreter, which greatly simplifies the coding process.</p>

                <p>Variable assignment in Python is done using the equals sign (=). When a value is assigned to a variable, the Python interpreter automatically determines the variable's data type. Python supports various types of data, including numbers, text, lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets, and more. The dynamic typing feature allows variables to even change type, which is known as dynamic typing.</p>

                <p>Strings (str) are sequences of characters used to store text. In Python, strings can be enclosed in either single quotes ('') or double quotes (""). Python treats single quotes the same as double quotes. Strings are immutable, which means once a string is created, it cannot be modified.</p>

                <h4>2.3 Type Conversion</h4>
                <p>Python allows explicit conversion of one data type to another, which is known as type casting. This can be useful when you need to perform operations that require uniform data types. The functions <code>int()</code>, <code>float()</code>, <code>str()</code>, and <code>bool()</code> are used to convert values to an integer, floating-point number, string, and boolean value respectively.</p>

                <p>Python supports a wide range of data types, which are categorized into several classes. These include not only the basic types like integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and booleans but also several built-in compound data types such as lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. Understanding these types is fundamental for effective Python programming.</p>
